# MiniBank
MiniBank implementation in .NET 5.0. 

Project consists of 3 SQL Server databases: Main, and 2 dependen (Rzeszów, Kraków). Main goal of the project was to use Distributed Transactions
but reality revealed that they are impossible for now in .NET 5.0. 

-Disclaimer:
Design of the database system has little to do with a real banking system. It is only an excuse to try out distributed transactions.
